This project analyzes monthly revenue and order volume from an **online_sales** dataset using SQL.

---

## âœ… Objective

Analyze sales data to understand monthly revenue and order volume trends over time. This helps businesses monitor performance, identify seasonal patterns, and make informed decisions.

---

## âœ… Summary

This project demonstrates how to:

- Extract and group sales data by year and month.
- Calculate monthly total revenue.
- Count the number of unique orders per month.

- c. Use `SUM()` for revenue.
- d. `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` for volume.
- e. Use `ORDER BY` for sorting.
